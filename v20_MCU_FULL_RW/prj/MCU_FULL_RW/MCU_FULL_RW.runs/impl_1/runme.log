If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is im/verify_RAM[5]. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: im/verify_RAM_inferred_i_11.
